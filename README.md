# 10KB Pixel Art Character
A pixel art character generator that delivers in under 10kb

This was a project made for <a href="https://a-k-apart.com/">10k Apart 2016</a>. The project works without any Javascript. All interactions are managed with CSS and the resulting choices saved with PHP to create the final image. 

Can you change images made with this generator? Yes, you're welcome to edit them to make them more personalised. Feel free to tweet these @kawaiihannahart ^_^ 

If you want to resize the image to make it larger/smaller, use 'Nearest Neighbour' interpolation and save as a PNG or GIF. This will keep the pixels nice and crisp.
